## Dependencies

In testing, we have identified version incompatibilities with Pandas. Please ensure your environment is configured with `pandas==1.3.0`. You can check your version of Pandas using the command `pip show pandas`. If your version of Pandas is not correct, please install the required version using the command `pip install pandas=1.3.0`.
