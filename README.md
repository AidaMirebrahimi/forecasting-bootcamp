# Forecasting Bootcamp

This repository contains demos and reference implementations for a variety of forecasting techniques that will be highlighted at Vector Institute's upcoming Forecasting Using Deep Learning Bootcamp in March 2022.

## Accessing Data

During the bootcamp, all reference datasets are available on the Vector cluster at ```/ssd003/projects/forecasting_bootcamp/bootcamp_datasets/```

For external use, we are providing the following link for downloading datasets:
- [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X-CgvkQKpatdPPrAYnWaeGmhA-daLJGr?usp=sharing)

Note that very large datasets (e.g. WeatherBench) are not included, and that more datasets will be added over time. 

## Main and dev branches

The AI Engineering team are using dev branches (e.g. [dev_demos](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/forecasting-bootcamp/tree/dev_demos)) to indicate works-in-progress. We invite you to view and begin experimenting with these resources, but please note that all meterial currently in development is subject to be modified, perhaps significantly, ahead of the bootcamp.
